# This is the List of all CAD needed parts.
## General recomendations

If you dont have the CATIA V5 r19, please send the file as an STEP file format.

Whoever is in charge of a part, should find the correct dimensions of said piece. 
Keep in mind, that you don't need to make a very complex part, make it as simple 
as you can, with the main elements visible. For example, you don't need to make 
the teeth on sprockets or gears and as well you should't make 3d threads because
they aren't very usable, but you need to make the holes for screws because these 
are usable elements.

If you find any part on the web, please cite the link here.
