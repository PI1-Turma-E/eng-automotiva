# AR2

A AR2 it the robotic arm chosen for use on ultrasound long-distance exam because of it's open source origin.

The arm is converted from the original STEP files to work on CATIA. There is still need to put on bearings and screws on the assembly and to modify or create some stuff to make it work on the final project.

## 6 axis stepper motor robot

This project includes:

- CAD on catia format for working
- Kinematic model

Should be noted that i deleted everything that isn't related to the CAD files.

All geared stepper motors and drivers are available from  [www.omc-stepperonline.com](https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/?tracking=59c1139e8987b) and all other misc. hardware are off-the-shelf items available from multiple sources (see the bill of materials file).

## Information

quick note: **Read the TODO**

really important: **Use the CATIA v5 r19 version** 

Everything here was laid down to us by the guy below, so please pay credit to him.

Some of the needed parts we will find on [McMaster-carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/)

On the end, we will need to make all the files to print again, as we change the model to fit our needs. If not, we could simply use the original git files to print
