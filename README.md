# AR2

A AR2 robotic arm for use on ultrasound long-distance exam. Slightly modified to use on CATIA

The arm is converted from the original STEP files to work on CATIA. There is still need to put on bearings and screws on the assembly and to modify or create some stuff to make it work on the final project.

## 6 axis stepper motor robot

This project includes:

- CAD on catia format for working
- Kinematic model

Should be noted that i deleted everythin that isn't related to the CAD files.

All geared stepper motors and drivers are available from  [www.omc-stepperonline.com](https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/?tracking=59c1139e8987b) and all other misc. hardware are off-the-shelf items available from multiple sources (see the bill of materials file).
